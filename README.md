I am by no means an expert in all things terminal, nor can I say that I haven't cherry picked bits of code that I liked from other projects. Packages, sources of inspiration and sources with valuable information include: 

* [ConsolKit](https://github.com/vapor/console-kit) from the folks that make Vapor, an http server in swift.

* [commandlinekit](https://github.com/objecthub/swift-commandlinekit) from Matthias Zenger over at Google

* [Termios](https://github.com/Ponyboy47/Termios) - a more comprehensive Swifty wrapper for termios than I have implemented here.

* [XTerm control sequences](https://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html) One of the definitive sources of console related info IMO.

* The standard C library [read function] (https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009604599/functions/read.html)

* [Blog](https://blog.nelhage.com/2009/12/a-brief-introduction-to-termios/) on terminal emulators and termios 

* On [buffering of low level input streams](http://www.pixelbeat.org/programming/stdio_buffering/) at the kernel level
