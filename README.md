I am by no means an expert in all things terminal, nor can I say that I haven't cherry picked bits of code that I liked from other projects. Packages and sources of inspiration include: 

[ConsolKit](https://github.com/vapor/console-kit) from the folks that make Vapor, an http server in swift.

[commandlinekit](https://github.com/objecthub/swift-commandlinekit) from Matthias Zenger over at Google

[Termios](https://github.com/Ponyboy47/Termios) - a more comprehensive Swifty wrapper for termios than I have implemented here.
