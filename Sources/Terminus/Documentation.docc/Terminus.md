# ``Terminus``
A toolkit for making command line applications.

## Overview

The goal of Terminus is to make writing visually appealing command line applications fast, efficient, and intuitive.  It aims to provide both high level building blocks like menus and user prompts (y/n, multiple choice, REPL, etc.) as well as lower level access to ANSI codes for users that want more complete control.

Terminus serves as bridge between the world of ANSI escape codes (aka terminal control sequences) and Swift.
